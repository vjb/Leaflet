Add different type of maps to your application, using [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/)! This widget is almost the same as the GoogleMaps widget, without the typical interaction you have in Google Maps, but with a wide variety of maps available.

## Building the widget

to build the widget for cloud deployments, you'll need to use:

npm run build-prod

and then copy the Leaflet.mpk file from the dist/ directory in this project to the widget/ directory of the target project
